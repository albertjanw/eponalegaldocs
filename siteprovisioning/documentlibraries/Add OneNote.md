# Add OneNote

Use this format to add an one note folder to a document library. The filename should contain *AddOneNote* and format is xls(x)

The following columns are required:

- Url or MatterCode (optional)

- DoclibSet

If *Url* is empty, the *MatterCode* is required. The Url should point to an existing doclib.

The *DoclibSet* contains the name of the doclibset.

Optionally add more columns when variables are used inside the OneNote settings in the doclibset.
