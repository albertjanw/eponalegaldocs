# Folder sets

You can defined one or more folderset. The folders can contain a variable.

Folder-names are splitted by a line break character. For example, create a Folders columns with a memo field-type to create dynamic folders (splitted by a line break character)

For each folderset you can define a default value for one or more columns using the *ColumnDefaultValues* setting. If you define multiple folders in 1 folderset, all the folders get the same default values.
