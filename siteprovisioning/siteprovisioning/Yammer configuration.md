# Yammer configuration

Yammer needs an OAUTH2 Accesstoken. This token can be manually generated via de the browser.

See here <https://developer.yammer.com/docs/test-token> for the steps to generate a token.

The result JSON contains an accesstoken that is valid for one year. Add this token to the Settings\\Yammer *AccessToken*

This procedure should be repeated when the token has expired.
