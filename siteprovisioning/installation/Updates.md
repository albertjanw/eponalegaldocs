# Updates

Download the new zipfile and extract the content. Stop the service or configurator and overwrite all the files. Plugins are stored in the subdirectory and should also be updated by copying the files from the plugin folder to the root folder.

Start the configurator. The config file(s) are automatically extended with optional new settings.
