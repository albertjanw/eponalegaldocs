# Clever Case

Use this plugin to connect the site provisioning service to the Clever Case time and billing application. Configure an url, username and password and map the clevercase fields to a sharepoint column.

*Client*\
a client is not required in CleverCase, but is required in DMSFL. Configure a default clientcode and clientname for matters that don't have a client (yet) in CleverCase.

*MatterNameUseDescription*\
If enable use the description field instead of the name for the mattername.
