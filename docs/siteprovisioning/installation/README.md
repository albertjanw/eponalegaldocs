# Installation

To install the tools extract the zip file to a folder, full control NTFS permissions are required for the user that is running the tools.

.Net 4.8 Framework is required.

Before starting the migration or site provisioning tool start the configurator to configure the tools.

To install the various plugins copy the files from the corresponding subfolder in the zip file to the root directory and restart the tools. The configurator tool will scan the current directory and adds the necessary settings. See the individual plugin chapters for more information.
